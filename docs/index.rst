Shape Measurement Fisher Formalism Package
=====================================

Fast simulations and analysis for the Weak Lensing Working Group of the LSST `Dark Energy Science Collaboration <http://www.lsst-desc.org>`_.

This software was primarily developed to study the effects of overlapping sources on shear estimation using the Fisher Formalism. 

The code is hosted on `github <https://github.com/ismael2395/ShapeMeasurementFisherFormalism>`_.  Please use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/ismael2395/ShapeMeasurementFisherFormalism/issues>`_ to let us know about any issues you have with installing or running this code, or to request new features.

This work was conducted by Ismael Mendoza, in collaboration with Pat Burchat and Josh Meyers, at Stanford University in 2015-2017. Work was supported by the National Science Foundation and by LSST.
