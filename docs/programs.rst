Programs
========

All available programs are contained in the top-level directory where this package is installed. Programs are written in python and use the '.py' file extension.

All programs are configured by passing command-line options. Pass the `--help` option to view documentation for these options, e.g.::

	python generate.py --help

.. This document provides an introduction to each of the available programs. Examples of running the programs are :doc:`documented elsewhere </examples>`. The flowchart below shows the main processing steps and relationships between these programs.

Executable Programs
===================

generate
--------

The `generate` program writes to a CSV file that can be later be read by the :mod:`galfun.py` or by :mod:`galfun.py` to generate galaxy images and their analysis. Fast image rendering with `galsim <https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim>`_.

The user specifies the arguments of the galaxy and the psf in the following way:: 

python generate.py -p PROJECT_NAME -gal 1 --galaxy-model MODEL_NAME --snr VALUE --PARAM1_NAME PARAM1_VALUE ... 

The project name, the galaxy model, the snr value, and the galaxy ID (in this case 1) should always be specified. One can optionally add a psf for 
the galaxy to be convolved with::

python generate.py -p PROJECT_NAME -gal 1 --galaxy-model MODEL_NAME --snr VALUE --PARAM1_NAME PARAM1_VALUE ... --psf_model PSF_MODEL_NAME --PSF_PARAM1 PSF_PARAM1_VALUE ... 

The psf and the galaxy are treated differently in the package. If you want to generate two galaxies just use the procedure above changing the id:: 

python generate.py -p PROJECT_NAME -gal 2 --galaxy-model MODEL_NAME --snr VALUE --PARAM1_NAME PARAM1_VALUE ... --psf_model PSF_MODEL_NAME --PSF_PARAM1 PSF_PARAM1_VALUE ... 

Then the csv file should contain information about both galaxies (one row per galaxy). It is recommended you use specify the same psf for both galaxies.


display
-------

The `display` program displays simulated images and analysis results stored in the CSV file generated by the `generate` program. It will display the images as they are produced unless the `--hide` argument is used when executed. Please run:: 

	python display.py --help 

For the images that can be produced and a short explanation for it. More information can also be found in :doc:`here </examples>`.


fitting
-------

The `fitting` program runs fits using :mod:`lmfit` as an alternative way of estimating the noise bias and error in order to compare it to the Fisher Formalism. 

In order to run a certain number N of fits, make sure you already created a galaxy with the `generate` program and then run:: 

	fitting.py -p EXISTING_PROJECT_NAME -rf -n N --snr SNR_VALUE

If you are Stanford SLAC afilliated and want send N batch jobs to SLAC, then log in to SLAC and then run:: 

	fitting.py -p EXISTING_PROJECT_NAME -rfs short -n N --snr SNR_VALUE
