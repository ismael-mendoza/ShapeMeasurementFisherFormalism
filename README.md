Software for Weak Lensing Fisher Formalism Studies
============================================

Fast simulations and analysis for the Weak Lensing Working Group of the LSST [Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org).

This software was primarily developed to study the effects of overlapping sources on shear estimation using the Fisher Formalism. 

User and reference documentation is hosted at http://weaklensingdeblending.readthedocs.org/ and also available as a [single pdf document](https://readthedocs.org/projects/weaklensingfisherformalism/downloads/pdf/latest/).
